Dynamic (shared) libraries

Dynamic libraries are different from static libraries in a way that by 
using them, during compilation process, GCC ads only code "hooks" and 
soname. That "hooks" and library soname are used during the startup of 
your application to load correct library and connect "inside" with the 
"outside" code. There are many advantages of using dynamic libraries. 
First of all Linux dynamic loader loads dynamic library only once, and 
than all programs use same copy of this library code.
